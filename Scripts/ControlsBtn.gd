# When pressed, change scene to controls scene
	# This scene should contain adaptive visuals. 
	# Have a "Movement" and "Sword" section.
	# Movement shows W,A,S,D for up, left, down, right respectively. Dodge is spacebar.
	# When these buttons are pressed while the player is on the scene, they should light up.
	# For gamepad, an outline of a gamepad is shown, with the left joystick moving as the gamepads joystick inputs are detected
	# For gamepad, dodge is either press down on the joystick or press a button. Will need testing to see which is better.
	# On the sword section, the keyboard/mouse player is shown an outline of a mouse. When the player moves their mouse the 
	# outline should shift a little to show input detection.
	# For the gamepad, their sword is their right joystick. This follows the same input detection showcase as the movement.
